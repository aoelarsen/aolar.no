[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4ce45616-d7c6-4d16-bd5c-2eb5c9a5f300/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aolar/deploys)

I'm a frontend mechanic :computer:...  or bicycle developer :mountain_bicyclist:... or something along those lines. 

This repo is filled with what will become my own part of this vast space called the internet. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and some other things.

Since I'm currently working as a bicycle mechanic :bicyclist:, this repo and the AOLar.no site will be a continuous work in progress and a space for trying out and learning new things. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions on my work, or just want to talk about all things bicycle related.

More to come...!
